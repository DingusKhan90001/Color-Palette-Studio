# Color-Palette-Studio
A simple HTML tool to create color palettes, that can be exported to PNG CSS JSON

This project borrows the colors.csv from https://github.com/aj90909/unofficial-pantone-solid-coated-2024-v5/blob/main/colors.csv, other CSV for colors should work with this as well though.

The colors can be rearranged by dragging and dropping after a color has been added to the palette.

The palettes can be exported in common formats.
